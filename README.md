This application is meant to run as a todo list for the user.

To use:
Type in a name for the task you want to create.
If there is a date and/or description, add those as well.
Press the Add button to add the task and additional values to the todo list.
The task should have a checkbox that can be toggled if the task is complete.

If you need to edit any tasks:
Click the row you would like to edit.
Double clicking on a value will allow an easy modification.
If double clicking is an issue, you may click on one of the respective edit buttons:
Rename, Edit Date, Edit Description.
The specific variable will be ready to edit.
Upon finishing, clicking elsewhere or pressing enter will overwrite your previous value.

If you would like to delete a row:
Click the row you would like to delete.
Click the delete button to remove that row entirely.

If you would like to delete all rows in your list:
Click the delete button.
A prompt will ask if you're sure that's what you want to do.
If it is, clicking yes will delete everything.

If you want to see only specific tasks by completion:
Click the Filter dropdown menu.
You may choose to show only tasks that aren't complete, tasks that are, or all tasks.

If you want to select a different file/list:
Click the file menu button and click Open...

If you want to save your todo list:
Click the file menu button and Save or Save As...
If you've never saved before, it will default to Save As...

If you are confused, click the Help menu.
